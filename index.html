        <b>Iron Man</b>
        , also known as Tony Stark, is a billionaire inventor who created a series of iconic armored suits, 
        each progressively more advanced and specialized for <strong>different challenges.</strong> His first suit, the bulky gray Mark I,
        was built in captivity and enabled his escape, <b>but upon returning home, Stark began developing sleeker designs such as the Mark II,</b>
         the first to integrate his AI JARVIS, which paved the way for high-tech features like flight and repulsor blasts.
